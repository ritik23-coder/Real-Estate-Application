# real estate
Android application to search and rent the housing options.
The project contains the login authentication using firebase as back end 
Firebase also stores the entire data in JSON format and is synced to the application
to reflect the changes. The activites include login activity, navigation activity which helps 
the user reach the navigation page from any where. The search activity contains some filters 
which need to be implemented to prevent the entire housing options to be shown. Hence this is
scalibility (issue to be done.)
In the list your property acitivity user needs to upload the property photos one by one.
We have used cloudinary services to store these images remotely.
Google Map api is integrated and location is marked at places appropriate for user.
Some custom layouts like coordinated layouts are implemented as this academic project
needs to implement many features. 
The about me page contains the developer information.
Feel free to contact us for any issues or problems with the app.
